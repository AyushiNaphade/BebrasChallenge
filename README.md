# BebrasChallenge
This purpose of this project is to develop an online platform for Bebras Challenge which is computational challenge
for students of various age groups,in school to excite them about computational thinking.
This platform will be open source and free.
The Bebras challenges are made of a set of short problems called Bebras tasks. 
The tasks are fun, engaging and based on problems that Computer Scientists enjoy solving. 
The tasks require logical thinking and can be solved without prior knowledge of computational thinking.
